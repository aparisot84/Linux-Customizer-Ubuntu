# Customize Ubuntu
A simple Shell Script to customize Ubuntu-like Linux Flavors

There are two main things this script does:

1 - Install some programs:<br>
    - Pycharm <br>
    - IntelliJ <br>
    - Clion <br>
    - PHPStorm <br>
    - Gparted <br>
    - Libre office Calc, Writer and Impress <br>
    - Curl <br>
    - Git <br>
    - Wget <br>
    - VirtualBox <br>
    - Wps Office <br>
      
2 - Install and configure ZSH. After the instalation the script download a copy of zshrc file and writes it to the zsh configuration file for the current user's folder. Then the ZSH is going to look exactly like the one in Kali Linux.

3 - Download the zshrc file in the correct directory
